## Overview
Real-time private and public chat room web app for authenticated users with simple user interface. Bringing the nostalgia of simplier times of chat-rooms for anyone you finds themselves missing the early 2000s, AOL, or MSN.

### Built With
- React (https://react.dev/)
- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en)
- Firebase (https://firebase.google.com/)
- CSS

### Summary of Learning 
As first project working with firebase, I relied heavily on the documentation in order to incorporate various aspects of the project including a database using firestore.
I enjoyed the ease of using firebase for authentication and would like to explore the MFA in future projects to build apps with additional layers of security. 
Additionally, I have become more confident working with React, constructing components and utilizing React hooks.
